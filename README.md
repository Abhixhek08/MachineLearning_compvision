# PCOS Identification via Computer Vision

## Overview

In this project, we aim to develop a computer vision system to identify Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using sonography images. PCOS is a common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, and early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to leverage computer vision techniques to analyze sonography images and classify whether ovaries exhibit signs of PCOS or not. By automating the identification process, we can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing PCOS more efficiently.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset of sonography images depicting ovaries with and without PCOS.

2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the images to enhance quality and remove noise.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the images, such as texture, shape, and intensity.

4. **Model Training**: Utilize machine learning or deep learning algorithms to train a classification model on the extracted features.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a standalone application or integrate it into existing healthcare systems for real-time PCOS identification.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Primary programming language
- Keras: Deep learning library for building and training neural networks
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- shutil: High-level file operations
- scikit-learn (sklearn): Machine learning library for model training and evaluation

## Potential Challenges

- **Data Availability**: Obtaining a diverse and representative dataset of sonography images may be challenging.
- **Model Interpretability**: Ensuring the interpretability of the model's decisions is crucial for clinical acceptance.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adhering to regulatory standards and ensuring the model meets healthcare industry requirements.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional modalities such as patient history or blood test results for improved diagnosis accuracy.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to interact with the system.
- Extend the system to perform real-time analysis of live sonography images during medical examinations.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Python and associated libraries such as Keras, Pandas, shutil, and scikit-learn, this project aims to contribute to the early detection and diagnosis of PCOS, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes for affected individuals.
